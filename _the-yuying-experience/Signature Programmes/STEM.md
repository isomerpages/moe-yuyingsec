<h2>STEM</h2>
<p>Students are exposed to various STEM education experiences.</p>
<p>Using the scientific inquiry model, our students collect data and create
prototypes for their various STEM projects. In the process, they apply
critical and inventive thinking skills to achieve optimal results.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding energy sources – building chemical-powered vehicles:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will put their science knowledge to the test by building their
very own vehicle prototypes.</p>
<p><strong>Coding and programming drones using Python:</strong>
</p>
<p>Through drone coding, students will develop computational thinking and
programming skills to be future-ready.</p>
<p><strong>Scent-making workshop</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will apply chemical separation techniques to concoct their own
DIY scent through the exploration of various chemical proportions.</p>
<p><strong>Maths around the world: A global VR adventure:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will take part in a globetrotting experience where they ‘travel’
to different cities in the world to solve mathematical problems.</p>
