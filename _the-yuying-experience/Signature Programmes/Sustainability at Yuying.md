<h2>Sustainability at Yuying</h2>
<p>Students are nurtured to be advocates for sustainability, our students
are exposed to a range of activities that instill in them a sense of responsibility
as stewards of the environment:</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will experience rice planting to understand the importance of
being able to grow food in our backyards.</p>
<p>Students will take on the responsibility of proper recycling methods.
This has earned our school the Best 3R award, recognising our excellence
in reducing, reusing and recycling.</p>
<p>Our Yuying x Dyson NTU collaboration taps on studentsâ€™ design-thinking
skills to innovate and design sustainable solutions for society.</p>
<p>Students will experience growing and harvesting vegetables in our vertical
farm. Students will go on learning journeys to high-tech farms to learn
more about indoor vertical farming</p>
