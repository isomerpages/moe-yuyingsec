<h2>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</h2>
<p><strong>Yuying C.A.R.E.S. (Collaborate. Act. Reflect. Empathise. Serve) </strong>
</p>
<p>Our Learning for Life programme focuses on the aspect of Community and
Youth Leadership. The programme provides opportunities for students to
acquire the skills required to champion social causes and become effective
changemakers in the community.</p>
<p>At each level, students have the opportunity to plan for activities to
meet the needs of the different sectors of society:</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 - Sustainability &amp; the Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will experience and empathise first-hand the problem of food
wastage. This encourages them to make better food choices.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 2 - Active Ageing &amp; the Elderly</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will apply design thinking to plan and execute their VIA projects.
This helps them to understand and address the needs of the elderly in our
society.</p>
