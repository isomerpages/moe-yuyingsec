<h3><strong>Sustainability Education at Yuying</strong></h3>
<p>At Yuying Secondary School, sustainability education is at the heart of
our learning culture. We believe in nurturing concerned citizens and active
contributors who care for the environment and take meaningful action to
build a sustainable future.</p>
<p>Our school’s sustainability journey is anchored in authentic learning
experiences that connect classroom knowledge with real-world applications.
Through our Food and Consumer Education (FCE), Science, and Mother Tongue,
students explore issues such as food security, energy conservation, and
resource management.</p>
