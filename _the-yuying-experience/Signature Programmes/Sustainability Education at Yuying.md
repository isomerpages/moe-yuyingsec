<h3><strong>Sustainability Education at Yuying</strong></h3>
<p>At Yuying Secondary School, sustainability education is at the heart of
our learning culture. We believe in nurturing concerned citizens and active
contributors who care for the environment and take meaningful action to
build a sustainable future.</p>
<p>Our school’s sustainability journey is anchored in authentic learning
experiences that connect classroom knowledge with real-world applications.
Through our Food and Consumer Education (FCE), Science, and Mother Tongue,
students explore issues such as food security, energy conservation, and
resource management.</p>

<p>The Dyson-NTU Sustainability Collaboration empowers students to become
innovators and changemakers through hands-on STEM learning. At the Dyson-NTU
Studio, students take part in immersive workshops and design challenges
that equip them with the skills to develop creative and sustainable engineering
solutions.</p>
<p>Students who have completed the programme return to guide their peers
in building solar-powered cars, applying principles of innovation, sustainability,
and renewable energy. This student-led experience not only deepens their
understanding of design thinking and problem-solving but also inspires
others to act towards a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Beyond lessons, our students take on the role of Eco Ambassadors, championing
green practices within the school and community. They plan outreach programmes,
conduct peer education, and lead school-wide initiatives such as the Earth
Day Carnival, where students advocate for environmental causes through
interactive exhibits and activities. Through these efforts, they contribute
towards national sustainability goals such as Singapore’s Green Plan 2030.</p>

Through sustainability education, we aim to inspire lifelong habits of
care, responsibility, and innovation for a greener tomorrow.</p>
