<h2>Student Management</h2>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Every Yuying student a self-disciplined individual of good character,
guided by strong values and empowered to make responsible choices.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<h4>SM approach</h4>
<p>An educative approach in guiding students to develop self-management and
good character:</p>
<p>- To create quality schooling and learning experience.</p>
<p>- To create safe boundaries, common understanding and common space.</p>
<p>- To ensure a caring and enabling environment for all.</p>
<p>In enacting a positive and proactive approach to discipline in school,
we consider these three aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Promote and Prevent</strong>
</p>
<p>At the centre of effective behaviour and classroom management are strong
teacher-student relationships and quality instruction. The SM committee
seeks to promote a safe and supportive environment and a culture of care,
strengthen protective factors and mitigate risk factors to prevent challenging
behaviours from occurring and disrupting learning.</p>
<p><strong>Address and Correct</strong>
</p>
<p>Despite preventive measures, students could still display inappropriate
behaviours due to various reasons. Inappropriate behaviour are addressed
promptly so that it does not disrupt teaching and learning, and correct
it before it affects students’ development and well-being. Addressing the
underlying reason(s) for inappropriate behaviour will result in sustainable
behavioural change.</p>
<p><strong>Replace and Restore</strong>
</p>
<p>As the ultimate goal is for students to develop self-discipline and good
character, the teachers work closely with misbehaving students to replace
their inappropriate behaviour with prosocial, appropriate ones, and to
restore relationships with others hurt by their actions. This also requires
consistent positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviour and peer support
to encourage habit formation.​</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>The school’s positive and proactive approach to discipline is in line
with MOE’s Discipline Framework.</p>
<p>Students learn well when there is order and discipline. At the same time,
they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve.
A judicious balance creates an environment conducive for their learning
and development. A positive, proactive approach to discipline develops
students’ readiness and motivation to learn, and enables them to feel safe
both physically and psychologically.</p>
<p>Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instill self-discipline
and good character in students. Discipline in schools goes beyond ensuring
behavioural compliance in students according to school rules and regulations.
It focuses on promoting positive student behaviour in support of learning
and growth through the teaching of values and skills, and timely reinforcement
through corrective guidance to address students’ misbehaviour. Discipline
is also about developing self-discipline and good character in our students,
and equipping them with the necessary social and emotional skills to behave
thoughtfully and be responsible and respectful individuals. We discipline
because we care.</p>
