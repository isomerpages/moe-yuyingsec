<h2>InnoTech Club</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>InnoTech Club aims to nurture a passion for innovation, technology and
design through hands-on experiences in robotics, coding, multimedia production,
and app development. Through a wide range of programmes such as Microsoft
Game Development, Google Content Creation, MakeCode Arcade, Thinkable App
Building, CoSpaces, Clipchamp Video Editing, and Drone Coding, members
are equipped with future-ready digital skills that reflect current industry
trends.</p>
<p>Our members also learn to build and program autonomous robots using LEGO
Spike Prime and are trained in drone navigation and coding. These skills
are put into practice through participation in national competitions such
as the First Lego League Challenge, Drone Odyssey Challenge, AI Alliance
Drone Competition, and Drone Maze Tournament, where they apply computational
thinking, engineering design and creative problem-solving to real-world
challenges.</p>
<p>The club also plays a vital role in the school community by providing
audiovisual and broadcast support during school events. Members are trained
in multimedia presentation, live production, video and graphics editing,
and animation, enhancing their technical proficiency and confidence in
using ICT tools.</p>
<p>Ultimately, InnoTech Club strives to develop students into self-directed
learners, collaborative team players, and innovative thinkers who can contribute
meaningfully to the digital future.</p>
