<h2>Photography Club</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>At Yuying Secondary School, the Photography Club empowers students to
see the world through a more thoughtful and creative lens. Members are
equipped with essential skills in digital camera handling and photography
techniques, learning to express compelling stories through their images.
Beyond technical training, students are encouraged to explore their artistic
voice and develop a strong visual sense.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, members actively contribute to the school community
by capturing key moments at school events and participating in Values-in-Action
(VIA) projects that use photography for a greater purpose. Outstanding
works are proudly showcased around the school, celebrating student talent
and dedication. The club also nurtures excellence by encouraging participation
in photography competitions and offering opportunities for learning journeys
that inspire and refine students' craft.</p>
