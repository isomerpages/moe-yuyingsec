<h2>National Cadet Corps</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) in our school provides a dynamic and disciplined
environment where students grow into confident leaders and responsible
citizens. Through a structured, military-based programme, cadets develop
resilience, teamwork, and a strong sense of commitment to Singapore. Activities
such as foot drills, fieldcraft, adventure training, and leadership development
foster both physical and mental strength. With opportunities for national
and international exposure, our NCC cadets gain valuable life skills and
a deeper appreciation of defence, service, and global citizenship.</p>
