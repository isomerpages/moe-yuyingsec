<h2>Girls' Brigade</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>The Girls’ Brigade (GB) aims to develop every girl and officer to her
fullest potential by equipping, empowering, and enabling each girl to be
a confident leader, and every officer to be a servant leader. At Yuying,
GB serves as a nurturing platform for our girls to grow in character, leadership,
and service.</p>
<p>Through purposeful weekly sessions and key events such as annual camps
and outreach activities, our girls are developed holistically—educationally,
spiritually, socially, and physically—to become individuals ready to make
a positive difference in society. The 70th Company offers our members meaningful
experiences and opportunities that foster a strong sense of pride and belonging.
Our alumni continues to return and serve, demonstrating the lasting impact
of the CCA.</p>
<p>During regular sessions every Friday from 2:00pm to 5:30pm, GB girls engage
in a rich variety of activities including devotions, badgework, recreational
games, and drill. These activities are designed to provide a broad learning
experience within one CCA.</p>
<p>Leadership development is a key focus. Our girls take on roles in the
Executive Committee or as Squad Leaders, gaining not only organisational
skills but also the humility and heart to lead by serving others.</p>
