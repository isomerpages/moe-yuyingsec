<h2>Boys' Brigade</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>As part of an international uniformed youth group which is the oldest
in continuous existence in the world, the Boysâ€™ Brigade (BB) offers a well-balanced
programme which aims to engage, excite, challenge and reward our Boys through
interesting and meaningful life enriching activities. The Company places
emphasis on learning and character building through adventure, via a range
of activities including kayaking, archery, abseiling, rock climbing, cycling,
team building activities and other ad-hoc sports related activities. This
consistent focus has produced Boys who are driven, confident, disciplined
and excellent team players.</p>
