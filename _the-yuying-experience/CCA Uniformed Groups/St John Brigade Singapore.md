<h2>St John Brigade Singapore</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>At Yuying Secondary School, the St. John Ambulance Brigade (SJAB) offers
students the chance to pick up meaningful life-saving skills while growing
as leaders and teammates. Guided by the motto “In the Service of Humanity”,
cadets are trained in Basic First Aid (BFA) and Basic Cardiac Life Support
with AED (BCLS), and can further pursue certifications in First Aid, Home
Nursing and Drill instructor courses. Along the way, they also learn to
take responsibility, plan events, and work closely with others. These experiences
shape them into confident and caring individuals.</p>
<p>Beyond training, cadets get to apply their skills through exciting opportunities
such as public duties and community events, including the Plant-A-Tree
initiative and the Paya Lebar Community Centre National Day Observance.
These experiences are not only meaningful but also rewarding, with our
unit achieving the 2025 Corps Achievement Award and placing First Runner-Up
in the District First Aid Competition. In SJAB, every cadet grows in confidence,
builds friendships, and discovers the joy of serving others.</p>
