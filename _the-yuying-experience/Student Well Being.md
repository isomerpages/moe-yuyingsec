<h2>Student Well-Being</h2>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Every Yuying Student a Peer Supporter.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Supporting our students' well-being through inclusive relationships and
positive role modelling, we equip students with social and emotional skills,
and develop healthy cyber wellness and mental wellness habits, helping
them to grow into resilient, lifelong learners.</p>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>We believe students thrive with support, connection and empowerment in
a caring and enabling environment.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes &amp; Activities</h3>
<p><strong>Buddy Mission<br></strong>A class-level buddy system to build
friendships, promote peer support, and foster class spirit through shared
missions throughout the year.
<br>
<br><strong>Peer Support Leaders<br></strong>As part of student leadership
development programme, students selected as Peer Support Leaders (PSLs)
will hone their skills in Peer Bonding, Peer Helping and Peer Influencing
with the guidance of teacher mentors. PSLs play a key role as upstanders,
advocates of help-seeking and healthy well-being habits, and providers
of first-level help for peers in distress.
<br><strong> <br>Breakfast with FTs<br></strong>A school-wide dedicated time
held twice a week for form teachers to personally check-in one-on-one with
students on their well-being.
<br>
<br><strong>Start the Day Right - Rise and Soar<br></strong>A school-wide
structured morning breathing practice to normalise emotional regulation
and reframe unhelpful thought patterns.
<br>
<br><strong>School-wide Programmes on Emotional Regulation, Cyber Wellness, Mental Well-being and Respectful Relationships<br></strong>As
part of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) learning experiences,
students develop skills on emotional regulation and peer relationship,
as well as safe and healthy cyber wellness and mental wellness habits.</p>
