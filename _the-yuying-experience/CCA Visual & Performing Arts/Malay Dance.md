<h2>Malay Dance</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>Yuying Malay Dance nurtures students into confident, disciplined, and
respectful individuals through the art of dance. We aim to cultivate self-discipline,
strong values, and an appreciation for the rich musical and rhythmic traditions
of Malay dance, while deepening their understanding of its cultural significance.</p>
<p>Our programme preserves the elegance of traditional Malay dance and encourages
exploration of the creativity and energy of contemporary styles. In addition,
students are given the opportunity to explore other ethnic dance forms
and modern genres such as street dance, broadening their exposure and versatility
as performers. We believe in each student’s potential and strive to develop
their talents, confidence, and leadership skills in a supportive environment.</p>
<p>Through various performance opportunities — both in school and at external
events — students gain valuable exposure while learning teamwork, resilience,
and the importance of giving their best.</p>
