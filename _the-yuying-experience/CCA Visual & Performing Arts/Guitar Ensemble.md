<h2>Guitar Ensemble</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>Yuying Guitar Ensemble (YYGE) aims to cultivate well-rounded musicianship
and foster a deep appreciation for collaborative music-making. Through
dedicated practice and performance, students will enhance their ensemble
playing skills, focusing on active listening, precise rhythm, and dynamic
expression within a group setting. We strive to expand repertoire knowledge,
exploring diverse musical styles and genres adapted for guitars. Beyond
technical mastery, the ensemble promotes teamwork, discipline, and and
commitment, as members learn to contribute effectively to a shared artistic
vision. We also give back to society by actively participating in Values-in-Action
(VIA) initiatives, leveraging our musical talents for community benefit.
Ultimately, we seek to build confidence and provide enriching performance
opportunities that inspire a lifelong love for music.</p>
