<h2>Guzheng Ensemble</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>The Guzheng Ensemble aims to nurture a deep appreciation for traditional
Chinese music while developing studentsâ€™ musical skills through the learning
and performance of the Guzheng. Open to all students regardless of prior
musical background, the Ensemble provides a supportive environment where
members grow together in both musicality and character. Through regular
practices, public performances, and competitions, students gain valuable
experience, build confidence, and develop discipline, resilience, and teamwork.
Leadership and mentorship opportunities are also offered, empowering senior
members to guide and inspire their juniors. We strive to cultivate not
only skilled musicians but also responsible and committed individuals who
take pride in preserving and promoting our cultural heritage.</p>
