<h2>Badminton (Boys)</h2>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>At Yuying Secondary, Badminton offers students the chance to grow both
in skill and character. Open to boys and girls, our CCA emphasises teamwork,
discipline, and resilience while creating an inclusive and supportive environment.
Through structured training, players improve their agility, focus, and
game sense, while also learning the importance of respect, responsibility,
and sportsmanship. Whether competing or playing for enjoyment, every member
is encouraged to give their best, support one another, and take pride in
representing the school. Beyond the court, badminton helps students build
confidence, friendships and values for life.</p>
