**1.    Discovery - Ideate and discover possibilities**

**2.    Application – Apply Design Thinking to meet real needs and solve problems**

**3.    Innovate– Innovate and embark on innovation projects**

**4.    Dream – Learn from local entrepreneurs who pursue their dreams and to define their own dream to improve people’s lives**


**Mission**: To develop innovative individuals with skills and attitude to impact the society positively.

#### Stages of Development

  

<b> Stage 1: Ideate </b>

Students learn about concepts such as product design and value creation. They apply brainstorming and ideation techniques to innovate.

  

<b> Stage 2: Apply Design Thinking </b>

Students apply Design Thinking Process (DT), which consists of these steps: <b> Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test </b>. Opportunities are provided for students to gather information from users and analyse their needs. Students take the extra step in consulting <b> (Empathise)</b> and confirming with users what those needs are <b> (Define)</b>. Then they proceed to brainstorm and apply ideation techniques to come up with possible solutions <b> (Ideate)</b>. They do a prototype <b> (Prototype) </b>and check with users if this prototype is able to meet their identified needs. After users have experience with the product or service, their feedback is sought <b> (Test)</b>.

  

<b> Stage 3: Innovation </b>

Students embark on innovation projects to apply what they have learnt through Design Thinking. These are carried out through school projects and external competitions.

  

<b> Stage 4: Dream </b>

Students connect design innovation with entrepreneurship. They learn from local entrepreneurs how a business is grown from the idea of value creation and how it benefits groups of people in our community. These are carried out through talks, learning journeys and short attachments or authentic learning experiences. Students are encouraged to reflect on their ALP journey and start looking for problems to solve and where to contribute. They make their own choices and follow their interests and passions, using their strengths and applying Design Thinking to create value.
