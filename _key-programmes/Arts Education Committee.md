Arts Education Committee
========================

The Arts Education Committee in Yuying is dedicated to creating new knowledge, skills and milestones for the students through the Arts. Its objective is primarily to engage students and deepen their appreciation for the Arts. This is done by enhancing their arts-related involvement in school and the community. The school also aims to develop them to showcase their talents and aptitude for the Arts through a multitude of avenues. 

  

Anchored to the 21st Century Competencies and CCE framework, it shapes the students’ experiences in the school and beyond. It also empowers students with opportunities and skillsets to be an appreciator, a contributor and a patron of the Arts.
