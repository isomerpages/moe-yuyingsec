### Leadership Trainings


Every Yuying student will be equipped with basic leadership skills. This is through the modules covered in CCE programmes for all levels. Students are then able to apply the values, skills and knowledge learnt by taking up leadership roles at class level, CCAs or school level. Student leaders will receive specific training for their roles. They are then given opportunities to apply the skills they have learnt through the activities / camps / events that they will have to organize.
