Learning for Life Programme
===========================

Here at Yuying, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), YUYING C.A.R.E.S (Collaborate. Act. Reflect. Empathise. Serve) focuses on the aspect of Community and Youth Leadership (CYL). To this end, our Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes provide opportunities for students to acquire the skills required to champion social causes and become effective changemakers in the community. VIA programmes in our school are also interdisciplinary in nature, as we seek to develop the head, hands and hearts of our students.

### Growing Through Varied Experiences
----------------------------------

YUYING C.A.R.E.S provides cohort-wide leadership training and values-in-action opportunities for the Secondary One through Three students through the EPIC process.Â 

#### Secondary 1

##### LLP Focus: Environment

Secondary 1 students develop their understanding of environmental issues as part of their Geography Investigation curriculum and deepen their knowledge through learning journeys. They are given the opportunity to apply their learning by undertaking environmental advocacy projects and sharing the message of 3R (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle) with the community.
