Full Subject-Based Banding
==========================

<b>Full Subject-based Banding (Full SBB)</b>

Yuying Secondary School is one of the 28 pilot secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards. 

  

<b>Purpose of Full SBB</b>

  

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.

  

<b>Full SBB Pilot in Yuying Secondary School</b>

Yuying has implemented the Secondary 1 and  2 mixed form classes since 2021. From 2020, Secondary 2 NA and 2 NT students are given the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level if they meet the requirements. Once the student offers Humanities at a more demanding level, he or she would sit for the same examinations as students in Express.
