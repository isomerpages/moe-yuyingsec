Full Subject-Based Banding
==========================

**Full Subject-based Banding (Full SBB)**

  

Yuying Secondary School is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards. 

  

**Purpose of Full SBB**

  

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.

  

**By 2021**, the pilot schools will have fully implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

Organising Secondary 1 form classes in new ways; or

Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2. 

  

**Full SBB Pilot in Yuying Secondary School in 2020**

  

As part of the pilot, our school will allow Secondary 2NA students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level if they meet the requirements.

  

**This is applicable to students who are in Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) in 2020.**

  

Towards the end of 2019, teachers will identify students from the Sec 1NA classes who show the aptitude and attitude as well as the ability to cope with the Humanities subjects. These selected students will be offered Literature, Geography or History at the Express level in 2020. Once the student offers Humanities at a more demanding level, he or she would sit for the same examinations as students in Express.
