YOOP 2022
=========

In the first week of the year, we welcomed our new Secondary One students to Yuying Secondary School. We have 8 Secondary One classes – **G (Gratitude), R (Responsibility), A (Adaptability),C (Courage), E (Empathy), F (Fortitude), U (Unity), L (Leadership)**.

  

All Secondary One students took part in the Yuying Secondary One Orientation Programme (YOOP), which was planned by our school prefects to induct the new students into our Yuying Family. As our students come from diverse backgrounds and different primary schools, the YOOP programme is an integral common experience that helps our students to get to know their new classmates and to feel a sense of belonging.

  

During the programme, our students took part in various activities that allowed them to work together as a class. One of the activities required students to decide on and commit to a class motto. Over the three days, laughter was heard and new friendships were forged. Apart from the fun-filled activities, the programme also prepared students to be ready for the new changes in secondary school through a transitional programme, **START RIGHT**.

  

The YOOP programme was mainly conducted and facilitated by our school prefects. The prefects did their best to help the Secondary One students feel comfortable in their new school environment. They also candidly shared their own experiences to help their juniors in their transition.

  

We hope that our Secondary One students are now ready for the school year!
