# Direct Schools Admission (DSA) Exercise for 2024 Intake

Direct School Admission (**DSA**) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Primary 6 (P6) students who do not participate in the DSA-Sec will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE results through the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.

At Yuying Secondary School, we nurture our students to be Wholesome Individuals with a Global Mindset, Passion to Learn and Spirit to Serve. We are on the lookout for driven individuals who demonstrate positive character traits as well as our school values of Integrity, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility to join our school through the Direct Schools Admission (DSA) exercise held once each year.

We welcome all current Primary Six students (or equivalent) to apply for 2024 admission to our school through the DSA-Sec exercise. We offer Singaporeans and foreign students who fulfil the minimum criteria for secondary school admission, have specific talents, and attained outstanding achievements in one or more of the following:

* Sports and Games – Volleyball (Girls)
* Sports and Games – Wushu (Boys and Girls)
* Performing Arts – Concert Band (Boys and Girls)

The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated from early-May. For more information on DSA-Sec, please refer to the MOE website at [www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec.]( https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec.)
