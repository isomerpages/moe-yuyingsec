<p><strong>Sustainability Education</strong> is a whole-school effort to inspire
students to become environmentally conscious leaders. Through our campus,
curriculum, culture, and community, students learn to embrace sustainability
in meaningful ways. From growing rice and understanding the importance
of reducing food waste to fostering a school-wide culture of recycling
and mindful living, students gain hands-on experience in sustainability.
Additionally, selected students collaborate with Dyson-NTU, applying design
thinking to address environmental challenges with a focus on energy sustainability.</p>
