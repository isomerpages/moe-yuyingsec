<h1>Science</h1>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Every Yuying student an innovative thinker and problem solver with a strong
foundation in scientific principles and practices.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To cultivate students' scientific inquiry skills and foster a positive
attitude towards learning, enabling them to appreciate and critically understand
the complexities of the world around them.</p>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>The Secondary School Science Education is centered around inquiry, allowing
students to ask meaningful questions, design experiments, and analyse data
to draw evidence-based conclusions.</p>
<p>We aim to provide a nexus between scientific concepts and real-life applications,
enabling students to see the relevance of science in everyday life and
equipping them with the skills to apply their knowledge to solve practical
problems.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Key Programmes &amp; Competitions</h4>
<p><strong>Secondary 1: Scientific Endeavors Involving Vertical Farming</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students carry out a scientific investigation involving hands-on experiments,
data analysis, and research projects to understand the scientific principles
underlying vertical farming. Students will design and conduct experiments
to test variables affecting plant growth in vertical farming systems. They
will collect, analyse, and interpret data to draw conclusions about optimal
growing conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 2: Learning Journey to Changi Jewel (a collaboration with the Mathematics Department)</strong>
<br>This immersive experience moves beyond traditional classroom settings,
allowing students to observe and understand the intricate connections between
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines in
tangible, real-world applications. At Jewel Changi, students explored how
mathematical principles underpin the stunning architectural design of the
building's iconic toroidal structure and the impressive HSBC Rain Vortex,
the world's tallest indoor waterfall and other features.This journey provides
a unique opportunity for students to witness firsthand how theoretical
STEM knowledge is seamlessly integrated to create a functional and awe-inspiring
environment, reinforcing the relevance and interconnectedness of their
studies.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Science - STEM Playground</strong>
</p>
<p>STEM Playground Challenge organised by the Science Centre Singapore with
James Dyson Foundation. Students are able to foster collaboration, exhibits
critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, while being explored to
STEM concepts in a fun and engaging environment. We seek to encourage studentsâ€™
curiosity, creativity and interest through innovation in these STEM challenges.
The challenges also develop school spirit alongside 21st Century Competencies
in our students.</p>
