The department adopts Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) into its curriculum. We are committed to create learning experiences to foster deep learning and instil a sense of inquiry and curiosity through a variety of approaches. Lesson packages have been developed and are constantly refined for each level to provide opportunities for students to develop 21 Century Competencies, especially in Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT).

The Science Department in Yuying makes use of a multi-disciplinary approach towards the teaching and learning of students. It typically includes interesting hands-on activities and experiential learning opportunities to engage and enthuse the students in the learning of Science and Technology.

Through the integration of the various disciplines in Science, Technology and Engineering, students were engaged in several intriguing activities and in one of those activities, they even crafted their very own kaleidoscope! The joy of learning of the students was evident in their enthusiastic participation in the activities.

Our programmes serve to pique students' interests in Science, Technology and Engineering and they aim to cultivate a more holistic appreciation of real-life phenomenon and applications.

#### Advanced Elective Module (AEM) 

AEMs in Science are offered to the students in Sec 3 Express and Sec 3 Normal (Academic), wherever possible. The AEMs are rotated among the 3 disciplines of Science, to expose the students to authentic learning experiences and to plant the seeds of passion and independent learning of Science.
