#### Vision

Critical and Compassionate learners in the 21 Century Competencies 

  

#### Mission

To cultivate an appreciation of the Humanities in the students; and instil in them a strong civic consciousness through varied teaching approaches in Humanities Education. 

  

#### Teaching and Learning Model/Approach/Pedagogy

The study of Humanities utilises the use of inquiry. This approach encourages questioning, critical thinking, investigation and problem solving in the exploration of issues surrounding us. 21st Century skills are infused in the Humanities lessons in order to nurture our students to be independent learners. Students undergo lessons that are incorporated with Thinking Routines, an element of Visible Thinking, to meaningfully foster critical thinking amongst the students.

    <td class="tg-vrgi">The study of Geography and History in Yuying involves the exploration process of learning through inquiry. This inquiry journey will allow students to embark on a learning experience that encourages questioning, investigation and critical thinking about issues affecting the environment, people’s lives, past and present.  It comprises four aspects of sparking curiosity, gathering data, exercising reasoning, and reflective thinking. Some of the issues our Lower Secondary students have looked into includes environmental conservation and waste management, National Service, housing challenges, past and present. <br><br>During the Covid-19 disruptions, the Geography and History Unit made changes to the investigative projects and continue to have students carry out the investigation projects in an authentic manner that taps on the online affordances. This has also greatly strengthened the digital literacy among students.<br></td>

#### Enrichment

Learning Journeys are integral to the holistic development of students. We believe in exposing our students to different ranges of issues – from self to national and global. 

  

Integrated Learning Journeys are planned to provide experiential learning that deepens the students’ understanding. Some of the learning journeys we have brought students for includes local learning journeys to the Hindhede Nature Park and historical districts such as Kampong Glam and tourist attractions like Orchard Road, where Geography students carry out fieldwork activities, Former Ford Factory where our History students extend their Historical understanding of the war and the Universal Studio Singapore, to deepen our EBS students’ understanding of the tourism industry.

To develop our students’ cultural intelligence, we have also brought many students for overseas learning journeys before (with the exception of the Covid-19 periods). Our students would get to interact with students from other countries such as Japan, Perth, Cambodia and Hong Kong. These trips are carefully planned to include what they have learnt in the classrooms and to develop their global awareness and cross-cultural skills, as well as deepen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore.
