The department embraces a blended approach to equip pupils with the knowledge, life-skills and learning experience. This is to equip students with the 21CCs to be able to adapt competently and show resilience in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous (V.U.C.A.) environment.

### Structured Sports eXposure (SSX)  


The following sports are organised to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for all levels in the school.

Secondary 1 - Netball and Volleyball

Secondary 2 - Pickleball and Basketball

Secondary 3 - Badminton and Futsal

Secondary 4 - Floorball and Softball

Secondary 5 - Tag Rugby and Scoop Ball

All levels - Physical Health and Fitness (PHF) and Outdoor Education (OE)

The department also takes pride in offering Exercise and Sports Science (ESS) as a GCE ‘O’ Level Subject. Exercise and Sports Science (ESS) is an interdisciplinary subject where students are grounded in the sub-disciplines of sports science with an understanding of sociology in relation to sports. Through the study of ESS,  students will develop disciplinary thinking and practices of the subject and thus interdisciplinary understanding.


### Key Events

* #####    **112 Km Challenge**

To commemorate the school’s 112th anniversary, in tandem with cultivating a culture of exercising regularly together, the department introduced the 112 km Resilience Challenge. The students within each class collectively worked together to achieve the collective goal of 1120 km using a running app, with awards distributed to the top 3 classes from each level with the longest distances. For students who were able to clock 112 km individually, they were awarded with a “Resilience Challenge 112 km” shirt!

* #####    **Yuying Olympic - Paralympic Fortnight (YO-PF)**

Secondary 1 - Sit-down volleyball

Secondary 2 - Seated Petanque

Secondary 3 - Goalball

Secondary 4 and 5 - Blind Cricket

YO-PF week was a key event that was conducted to build awareness of Paralympic sports and values among our students. Paralympic week was also conducted to try to change the way young people view disabilities and promote their participation in these sports. To culminate our Yuying Olympic Paralympic Fortnight (YOPF), we invited Miss Joan Hung, a national goalball athlete, to share more about her experiences as an athlete with visual impairment and how she challenged herself to overcome life’s obstacles.
