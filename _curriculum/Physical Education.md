### Key Programmes and Events
-------------------------

  

##### Bossaball Tournament

The flagship sport and pride of Yuying Secondary School as the only school in Singapore to integrate the Bossaball programme into the PE Curriculum.  It is a net barrier game played on an inflatable court between two teams. It combines the skills from volleyball, sepak takraw and soccer in the game.  

  

As a regular feature in the school calendar, an inter-class Bossaball Challenge is held annually to award classes excelling in this sport with the exception of the Covid-19 periods.

##### Secondary Three Camp - Camp Resilience

The Secondary Three camp sees students learning resilience through a series of planned activities in school. The students will forge greater relationships among their peers while working together in varied activities. With authentic outdoor learning as platforms for form teachers to observe their students. It also allows peers to interact with each other in a natural environment to develop appreciation of their surroundings and relationships. The camp seeks to enrich, empower and enhance students’ experience in multiple ways which are important in lifelong learning.

##### Class Sports Competition

All students have the opportunity to attest their skills after going through the structured modular sports system. Sports such as Badminton, Volleyball, Frisbee, Netball, Futsal and Pickleball are the core sports that all Yuying students receive in their secondary education journey. Since Covid19, the structure of the competition has shifted from that of inter-class to class-based competition. This is to ensure that the students are given the semblance of healthy physical activities and the camaraderie despite the current landscape.

##### S.T.A.R.R.S. Programme 

The S.T.A.R.R.S (Students Trained As Responsible and Resilient Sportsmen) engages students in modalities which are proven to heighten body-recomposition. Most sessions take place in the gym which is revamped with a plethora of equipment for building strength and cardiovascular fitness. The school also plans novel sports to enthuse the students in unique activities.  Students are also given opportunities to be exposed to a wealth of information and are guided to apply these information.

  

This year, the selected students for this programme are encouraged to take on a digital platform to track their food intake and exercise regime. This requires more ownership from the students as they get to decide on the type of workout to engage in weekly. 

##### YYSS Circuit Breaker Challenge in conjunction with 110th  anniversary

To reinforce the spirit behind the Olympic Motto of “Citius, Altius, Fortius” (Faster, Higher, Stronger), students’ personal excellence were put to the test during the Olympic Challenge. 

  

In view of Covid19, the challenge has taken on another platform. Staff and students are to observe the Safe Management Measure by recording their individual workouts at the comfort of their home. To attain the award of an in-house customized designed tee shirt, participants would have to complete 11 sets of 10 workouts within a stipulated period. This is one of the many ways the school encourages both the staff and students to stay active during the pandemic.
