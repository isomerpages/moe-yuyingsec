<h3>Key Programmes &amp; Competitions</h3>
<p><strong>1. Secondary 1 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp (Zenith Quest)</strong>
</p>
<p>A foundational camp that builds confidence, friendships, and teamwork
through rich NE stations, team games, and low-element challenges. Students
grow in resilience and adaptability as they transition into secondary school.</p>
<p><strong>2) Secondary 3 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp (Ascendancy Conquest)</strong>
</p>
<p>The department delivers a capstone adventure that focused on leadership
and perseverance. Students take on activities, kayaking, and expeditions,
strengthening collaboration and self-reliance in a challenging outdoor
setting. In 2026, Sec 3 students would be attending OBS.</p>
<p><strong>3) Inter-class Games</strong>
</p>
<p>The annual fun, competitive platform where students apply the sport skills
adapted from the PE syllabus. Classes compete in age-appropriate team sports,
promoting sportsmanship, teamwork, and class spirit in a lively and engaging
environment.</p>
<p><strong>4) Paralympics Week</strong>
</p>
<p>Students experience adapted sports like seated volleyball, boccia and
goalball to foster empathy, inclusivity, and respect for persons with disabilities
through hands-on learning as part of the Disability Sports Masterplan 2024.</p>
<p><strong>5) Exercise and Sports Science (ESS) (Syllabus 6081)</strong>
</p>
<p>Upper Secondary students will be offered ESS, a subject that combines
theory and practice in movement science, biomechanics, and sports psychology.
This prepares students for future studies in sport-related fields and project-formats.</p>
<p><strong>6) Strength Over Adversity (S.O.A.) Run </strong>
</p>
<p>A mass run that encourages healthy competition among students, while strengthening
care culture, and building mental resilience through collective participation.
Student leaders from both CCAs and prefectorial board are the students'
voice in organising the event and rallying the school for mass cheer. This
is a good opportunity for them to lead by example, support peers during
activities, and grow in leadership and communication skills."</p>
