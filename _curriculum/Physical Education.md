### Our Mission

The department embraces a blended approach to equip pupils with the knowledge, life-skills and learning experience. This is to equip students with the 21CCs to be able to adapt competently and show resilience in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous (V.U.C.A.) environment.


### Structured Sports eXposure (SSX) 
The following sports are organised to promote an active and healthy lifestyle for all levels in the school.

Secondary 1 - Netball and Volleyball

Secondary 2 - Pickleball and Basketball

Secondary 3 - Badminton and Futsal

Secondary 4 - Floorball and Softball

Secondary 5 - Tag Rugby and Scoop Ball

All levels - Physical Health and Fitness (PHF) and Outdoor Education (OE)

The department also takes pride in offering Exercise and Sports Science (ESS) as a GCE ‘O’ Level Subject. Exercise and Sports Science (ESS) is an interdisciplinary subject where students are grounded in the sub-disciplines of sports science with an understanding of sociology in relation to sports. Through the study of ESS,&nbsp;&nbsp;students will develop disciplinary thinking and practices of the subject and thus interdisciplinary understanding.


### Key Events

* #####    **Yuying Olympic - Paralympic Fortnight (YO-PF)**

Secondary 1 - Sit-down volleyball

Secondary 2 - Seated Petanque

Secondary 3 - Goalball

Secondary 4 and 5 - Blind Cricket

YO-PF week seeks to build awareness and instil values of the various paralympic sports in our students. It also aims to nurture students to be more inclusive when engaging in sports. 

* #####    **Tiktoks in PE**

Students use the Tik Tok platform to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the sport that they have learnt during PE lessons. It is a meaningful process where students brainstorm ideas together, film and edit content through a novel and creative approach to demonstrate their learning.

* #####    **Interclass Games (ICG)**

There are various sports that all Yuying students participate in their secondary education journey, some of which are net-barrier (eg. pickleball and badminton), territorial-invasion (eg. futsal and frisbee) and striking-fielding sports (e.g. softball).


* #####    **Highlights from Outdoor Education Lessons**

There&nbsp;is so much more to PE lessons than sports and exercise. PE lessons are also used as platforms for students to be well-equipped with the skills and knowledge for outdoor learning. The series of outdoor education lessons forge greater relationships among peers while working together in varied activities. It also allows peers to interact with one another in a natural environment to develop appreciation of their surroundings and relationships. Students are presented with the task of setting up a shelter by constructing a basha together with their peers and cooking outdoors using the necessary equipment.

Exercise &amp; Sports Science
=========================

Exercise &amp; Sports Science (ESS) is an interdisciplinary applied subject where students are taught to perform and participate in various sports. They will also be exposed in-depth to disciplines of Biomechanics, Physiology, Sociology, Psychology and Motor Learning &amp; Development.&nbsp;

  

ESS provides a plethora of opportunities for students to develop 21st Century Competencies where theories and concepts are applied in authentic learning contexts. Students will learn to manage uncertainties as teams and adapt to diverse challenges from the myriad of experiential learning experiences. They strive to become effective communicators who can employ multiple perspective-taking when dealing with the complexities in life. ESS aims to develop individuals who can take on new challenges and be future-ready.
