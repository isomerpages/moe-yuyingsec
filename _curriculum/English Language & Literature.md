<h1>English Language &amp; Literature</h1>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Every Yuying student an articulate and thoughtful communicator.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>Empowering students with the skills and confidence to use language purposefully
and impactfully in a changing world.</p>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>Teaching English Language and Literature is about nurturing thoughtful,
articulate individuals who value clarity, empathy, and integrity in communication.
We believe that language is a powerful tool not just for academic success,
but for personal growth and social impact. Through rich experiences in
reading, writing, speaking, and listening, we help students make sense
of the world around them — and equip them to contribute meaningfully to
it.</p>
