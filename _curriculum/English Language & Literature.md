#### Approach

In Yuying Secondary School, the English Language (EL) department does not teach merely the subject; we teach Life. The philosophy “We Lead, We Care, and We Teach Life” undergirds the teaching and learning of EL. Aligned to the EL Syllabus, the department focuses on helping students to make sense of the world they are in, and empowering them to impact the community around them through the purposeful use of language. At the end of their 4-5 years with us, students will appreciate EL as a lingua franca that allows them to navigate the 21st century in a meaningful and purposeful way.

Given the diverse profile of our students, a principled blend of teaching methods is adopted to ensure that all our students learn. The department uses a repertoire of pedagogical approaches to ensure effective teaching and learning in the classrooms.

**Dialogic Teaching and Learning**

The 3-year Whole School Approach to Effective Communication (WSA-EC) journey has resulted in the effective use of classroom talk to impact learning. One of the department’s pedagogical approaches is harnessing the power of talk in the classroom to stimulate and extend students’ thinking. The dialogic teaching and learning approach helps to advance students’ learning and understanding through generative conversations in the class and interactions between the teacher and students. This, in turn, heightens the personal engagement with the subject matter.

**Thinking Routines & Protocols**

Visible thinking routines and protocols are weaved into the teaching of the units in class. There is a deliberate focus on developing thinking skills from the time they enter our school. With the understanding that skilful critical thinking has to be taught explicitly and modelled, teachers employ the use of thinking routines to empower students to question and deepen their learning. Beyond possessing in-depth knowledge, we develop our students’ capacity to generate and create new ideas.

**Harnessing Technology**

The EL department uses ICT as a tool for teaching, taking into consideration the pedagogical affordance, social affordances and most importantly, the technological affordances. Hence, ICT is a vehicle which enhances teaching and learning to support the achievement of objectives. Through the understanding of affordances, teachers are able to skilfully select the relevant ICT tool to facilitate learning and develop digital literacy in our students at the same time.
