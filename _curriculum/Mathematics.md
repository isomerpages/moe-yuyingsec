The teaching, learning and assessment of mathematics in Yuying is anchored by the pentagonal framework shown above. In the learning of mathematics, mathematical problem solving is the central focus. The five sides of the pentagon detail the process and knowledge the students require to acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills in various situations, including non-standard, open-ended and real-world problems.

  

#### Desired Learner Outcome

Every student to develop an interest in mathematics and value add academically.

  

#### Achievements

The department believes in providing opportunities to students to participate in competitions. The teachersâ€™ involvement in the training of the students for these competitions not only forges a stronger bond between teachers and students, it also makes the students more confident. So far the students have done the school proud. In the 2021 All Singapore Mathematics Competition, the students achieved 4th placing in the Team Event and 6th placing in the Individual Event for Upper Secondary Normal Academic. In the 2021 Australian Mathematics Competition, 24 students took part, with 9 of them achieving distinctions and the rest achieving credits.
