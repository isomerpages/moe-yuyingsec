<h1>Mathematics</h1>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Every Yuying student a resilient learner who confidently leverages mathematical
thinking for real-world innovation.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To nurture an appreciation for Mathematics in students and equip them
with critical thinking and mathematical problem-solving skills to become
independent life-long learners who actively contribute to society.</p>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>Our mathematics philosophy is centered on developing critical and adaptive
thinking, problem-solving skills, and logical reasoning in our students.
We aim to nurture curious, creative, and confident learners who are equipped
to tackle complex challenges. Through student-centered learning, real-world
applications, and inquiry-based learning, we want to foster an appreciation
for mathematics and a growth mindset, empowering students to become contributing
and innovative lifelong learners, capable of analysing, evaluating, and
justifying mathematical arguments. We strive to inspire a passion for learning
mathematics that extends beyond the classroom, and to equip students with
the skills and confidence to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes &amp; Competitions</h4>
<p>Our <strong>Secondary 1 </strong>students carry out a research project
focused on sustainability, leveraging real-world data and technology to
analyse, interpret and present their results. They applied their findings
to solve critical issues like reducing our carbon footprint and fighting
climate change, demonstrating how mathematics can address real-world problems.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Secondary 2</strong> students go on an exciting interdisciplinary
(Mathematics and Science) Learning Journey to Jewel Changi, Singapore.
This immersive experience moved beyond traditional classroom settings,
allowing students to observe and understand the intricate connections between
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines in
tangible, real-world applications. At Jewel Changi, students explored how
mathematical principles underpin the stunning architectural design of the
building's iconic toroidal structure and the impressive HSBC Rain Vortex,
the world's tallest indoor waterfall and other features. This journey provides
a unique opportunity for students to witness firsthand how theoretical
STEM knowledge is seamlessly integrated to create a functional and awe-inspiring
environment, reinforcing the relevance and interconnectedness of their
studies.</p>
<p>Our<strong> Secondary 3</strong> students carry out a Mathematics and Art
project, where use the Desmos graphing app to transform abstract functions
into vibrant visual art. By strategically graphing various equations—including
linear, quadratic, circular, and trigonometric functions—and carefully
applying domain and range restrictions, students meticulously "draw" intricate
images and pictures. This hands-on experience provides opportunity not
only for students to deep their understanding of mathematical concepts
but also to apply their knowledge and mathematical thinking creatively,
inspiring remarkable visual artistry.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics Around the World: A Global Virtual Reality (VR) Adventure</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students experience a thrilling Virtual Reality journey where Mathematics
comes to life across different countries and cultures. They apply mathematical
concepts to real-world problems such as discounts and profits and currency
exchange, and discover the geometric architectural marvels like the Eiffel
Tower and pyramids. This immersive VR experience not only highlights the
universal importance of Mathematics but also reveals its fascinating applications
across the globe.</p>
