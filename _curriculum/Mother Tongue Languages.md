<h1>Mother Tongue Languages</h1>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>Every Yuying student a confident and proficient communicator, rooted in
the cultural heritage of their Mother Tongue Language.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>To provide joyful, purposeful, and authentic language learning experiences
that deepen cultural understanding and values, strengthen communication
skills, and foster a strong connection to the Mother Tongue Language.</p>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>We believe every student can grow in their Mother Tongue Language when
supported by a strong partnership among school, home, and community. Rooted
in the principles of communication, culture, and connection, we are committed
to nurturing confident learners who value their heritage, embrace cultural
diversity, and use their Mother Tongue Language effectively and meaningfully
in daily life, both inside and beyond the classroom.</p>
<h4>Key Programmes &amp; Competitions</h4>
<p><strong>Read@Yuying</strong>
</p>
<p>The MTL Reading Programme has designated reading materials for every level.
Students read these books during silent reading period and in class. Students
are encouraged to continue reading the materials during the school holidays
to improve their MTL.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Language Fortnight</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of Mother Tongue Language Fortnight, a series of programmes are
designed to provide students at all levels with meaningful platforms to
actively learn the Mother Tongue Language and explore its rich cultural
heritage. These activities, conducted both in and beyond the classroom,
include learning journeys, competitions, talks by invited guests, handicraft
workshops, and language skills sessions. They offer authentic opportunities
for students to use the Mother Tongue Language and experience it as a living
language.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Language Cultural Enrichment Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Language and Culture Enrichment Programme is a post-examination
activity that provides students with meaningful opportunities to use their
Mother Tongue Language and appreciate their cultural heritage. Activities
such as handicraft workshops, learning journeys, and food tasting allow
students to experience the language in fun, hands-on ways beyond the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Festive Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p>Students take part in celebratory activities for the Lunar New Year, Hari
Raya, Deepavali, and the Mid-Autumn Festival. These celebrations foster
greater awareness and a deeper appreciation of the cultures and traditions
of Singapore’s diverse ethnic groups. In addition, students are encouraged
to take on active roles as emcees for the programmes and to showcase their
talents through stage performances, thereby enriching their cultural understanding
and building confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Performance and Exposure Scheme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme provides students with opportunities
to attend Chinese and Malay language stage and theater performances by
local and international arts groups. These experiences help students develop
an appreciation for the performing arts while enriching their language
learning.</p>
<p><strong>Publication of Students Essay</strong>
</p>
<p>The publication of Students’ Essays in Chinese and Malay languages provides
a platform to showcase the outstanding written work of our students. This
initiative not only celebrates their creativity and expression but also
aims to enhance their writing skills by encouraging effective and confident
communication. By sharing their essays publicly, students gain valuable
experience and motivation to further develop their language abilities."</p>
