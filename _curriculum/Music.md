<br>Yuying Secondary School provides a two-year music curriculum that is specially
designed to fulfill the aims of the General Music Programme and to meet
the needs of our students. It is also aligned to the school’s Aesthetic
Education Programme, where music is seen as an integral part of students’
lives. We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to develop
his/her potential for creativity and expression through music education
in school.
<br>
<br>Our music programme aims to develop creativity and musicianship skills
through three main processes which are to gain musical knowledge, sing
or play an instrument and to create music. During the course of implementation,
students will be exposed to the various genres and cultural music in Singapore
as well as around the globe, thereby developing an understanding, respect
and appreciation towards music of different cultures. They will also be
able to express themselves through interactive and creative music-making,
so that they may become aspiring musicians and individuals.

<br>Music Education Programme
<br>To cater to the demands and needs of the 21st century learners, we have
developed and introduced new learning strategies such as spiral learning
and self-directed learning in our music programme.

</p>
<p>Our Secondary One students will be introduced to a 10-week ukulele module
that teaches them how to read chord diagrams and play some popular songs
on the ukulele. This trains their perseverance, discipline and eye-hand
coordination. With the ukulele being one of the most popular and easiest-to-learn
instruments, students have become more confident in learning and performing
music.
<br>
<br>After having learnt an instrument in Secondary One, students advancing
to Secondary Two will be introduced to a 10-week keyboard module. They
will learn some basic music theory on how to read notes using Western Music
notation, basic chords in root position and play some popular songs on
the flexi-keyboard. This trains their coordination to play using one hand/both
hands as well as hone their teamwork skills to play as a duet. Students
are also encouraged to do self-directed learning where they will research
and present to their peers about music from different World Music cultures.
On top of that, they will also create music using technology such as music
apps on the iPad. Students have become more independent in their learning
and innovative with their creativity when creating and performing music.

<br>At the end of the two years, we believe that students will be nurtured
into more confident, resilient and creative individuals who will be able
to inspire others with their talents in the future.
