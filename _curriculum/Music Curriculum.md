Music Curriculum
================

Yuying Secondary School provides a two-year music curriculum that is specially designed to fulfill the aims of the General Music Programme and to meet the needs of our students. It is also aligned to the school’s Aesthetic Education Programme, where music is seen as an integral part of students’ lives. We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to develop his/her potential for creativity and expression through music education in school. 

  

Our music programme aims to develop creativity and musicianship skills through three main processes which are to gain musical knowledge, sing or play an instrument and to create music. During the course of implementation, students will be exposed to the various genres and cultural music in Singapore as well as around the globe, thereby developing an understanding, respect and appreciation towards music of different cultures. They will also be able to express themselves through interactive and creative music-making, so that they may become aspiring musicians and individuals.

### Music Education Programme


To cater to the demands and needs of the 21st century learners, we have developed and introduced new learning strategies such as spiral learning and self-directed learning in our music programme.

Our Secondary One students will be introduced to a 10-week ukulele module that teaches them how to read chord diagrams and play some popular songs on the ukulele. This trains their perseverance, discipline and eye-hand coordination. With the ukulele being one of the most popular and easiest-to-learn instruments, students have become more confident in learning and performing music.

  

After having learnt an instrument in Secondary One, students advancing to Secondary Two will be introduced to a 10-week keyboard module. They will learn some basic music theory on how to read notes using Western Music notation, basic chords in root position and play some popular songs on the flexi-keyboard. This trains their coordination to play using one hand/both hands as well as hone their teamwork skills to play as a duet. Students are also encouraged to do self-directed learning where they will research and present to their peers about music from different World Music cultures. On top of that, they will also create music using technology such as music apps on the iPad. Students have become more independent in their learning and innovative with their creativity when creating and performing music.

At the end of the two years, we believe that students will be nurtured into more confident, resilient and creative individuals who will be able to inspire others with their talents in the future.
