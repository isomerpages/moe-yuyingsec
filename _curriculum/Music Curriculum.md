Music Curriculum
================

![](/images/Musicc1.jpeg)


Yuying Secondary School provides a two-year music curriculum that is specially designed to fulfill the aims of the General Music Programme and to meet the needs of our students. It is also aligned to the school’s Aesthetic Education Programme, where music is seen as an integral part of students’ lives. We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to develop his/her potential for creativity and expression through music education in school. 

  

Our music programme aims to develop creativity and musicianship skills through three main processes which are to gain musical knowledge, sing or play an instrument and to create music. During the course of implementation, students will be exposed to the various genres and cultural music in Singapore as well as around the globe, thereby developing an understanding, respect and appreciation towards music of different cultures. They will also be able to express themselves through interactive and creative music-making, so that they may become aspiring musicians and individuals.

### Music Education Programme


To cater to the demands and needs of the 21st century learners, we have developed and introduced new learning strategies such as spiral learning and self-directed learning in our music programme.
