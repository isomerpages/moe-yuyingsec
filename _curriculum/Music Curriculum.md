Music Curriculum
================

![](/images/Music1.jpeg)

Yuying Secondary School provides a two year music curriculum that is specially designed to fulfill the aims of the General Music Programme and to meet the needs of our students. It is also aligned to the school Aesthetic Education Programme, where music is seen as an integral part of students’ lives. We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to develop his/her potential for creativity and expression through Music education in school. 

  

Our music programme aims to develop creativity and musicianship skills through three main processes which are to gain musical knowledge, sing or play an instrument and to create music. During the course of implementation, students will be exposed to the various genres and cultural music in Singapore as well as the global world, thereby developing an understanding, respect and appreciation towards music of the different cultures. They will also be able to express themselves through interactive and creative music making, so that they may become aspiring musicians and individuals.

### Music Education Programme
-------------------------

To cater to the demands and needs of the 21st century learners, we have developed and introduced new learning strategies in our music programme.

Our Secondary One students will be introduced to a 7 weeks Ukulele module that teaches them how to read chord diagrams and play some popular songs on the Ukulele. This trains their perseverance, discipline and eye-hand coordination. With Ukulele being one of the most popular and easiest-to-learn instruments, students have become more confident in learning and performing music.

  

After having learnt an instrument in secondary one, students advancing to secondary two will create their very own music performance in groups. On top of that, they will also learn how to create music using technological music apps on the iPads. 

  

At the end of the two years, we believe that students will be nurtured into more confident, resilent and creative individuals who will be able to inspire others of their talents in the future.
