Grow-Inc is made up of a group of enthusiastic and nature-loving students who are passionate to champion environmental causes such as food sustainability and water conservation. As Singapore gears up for a greener future, the club believes the answers to environmental challenges lies in our young people's ingenuity and responsibility to be good stewards of the environment with informed, and sustainability-conscious mindsets. The club has forged close partnerships with NParks, National Environment Agency (NEA) and National Institute of Education (NIE) over the years through our collaboration on various sustainability and gardening projects.

The Grow-Inc club has also represented the school in a variety of sustainability-related competitions. One such competition is the annual North East G!nnovation Challenge, which challenges schools to propose innovative ways to solve environmental problems. Through initiatives like promoting water conservation through a skit, scientific analysis of food wastage in the canteen and organising a plastic bottle collection drive, our members go out of their way to instil sustainability into the rest of the school. 

With sustainability as the cornerstone of Singapore’s continued development and her recognition as a “City in a Garden”, Grow-Inc students have also explored setting up a community garden in the school compound to grow a variety types of edible herbs and vegetables.
