Grow-Inc is made up of a group of enthusiastic students who are passionate to champion environmental causes such as reducing food waste and water conservation. As Singapore gears up for a greener future, the club believes the answers to environmental challenges lies in our young people's ingenuity and responsibility to be good stewards of the environment with informed, and sustainability conscious mindsets. 

  

Annually, Grow-Inc club members participate in NEA's G!nnovation Challenge. In 2021, the students clinched the North East G!nnovation Challenge 2021 Championship in which they had created short video clips to showcase their solutions and raise awareness on environmental issues, particularly on water conservation. Through this process, our students demonstrated critical thinking, problem solving skills and environmental stewardship.  The club also collaborates with NParks, National Environment Agency (NEA) and National Institute of Education (NIE) on sustainability projects.
