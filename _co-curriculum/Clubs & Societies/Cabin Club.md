Cabin Club
==========
Cabin Club is an alternative space which provides a safe environment for students to hang out after school hours to enjoy facilities such as internet access, gaming consoles and board games, or engage in meaningful activities which inculcate important values or impart social skills such as relationship management and effective communication. It is also a space where teachers engage in conversations with students to build rapport, provide mentorship and do assessments of needs and risks in a non-intrusive manner.
