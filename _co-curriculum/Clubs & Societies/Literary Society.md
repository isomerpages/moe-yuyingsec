The Literary Society aims to develop imaginative explorers with open hearts and minds. Our members learn to hone their communication skills as they engage in drama activities and immerse themselves in the imaginary world of stories. They also deepen their understanding of themselves and the world around them when they create thematic displays for the school library. The members also play an indispensable role in supporting school-wide initiatives that inspire a love for reading.

  

In 2021, our members took the challenges of e-CCA in their stride, participating actively in every e-CCA session while also learning new skills. They applied their new knowledge on how to film and edit video footage from different perspectives to present a short film in a tribute to teachers as part of the 2021 Teachers’ Day Celebrations.
