In Yuying Photography Club, our members are nurtured to develop keen observation skills of their environment and space, using their imagination and creativity to paint a narrative and using photography as an artistic medium to communicate their ideas. They are taught basic camera handling techniques and post-production skills to further enhance their photos. Members get opportunities to go on learning journeys to different parts of Singapore to hone the photography skills they have learnt.
