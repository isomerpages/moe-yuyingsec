<h2>Photography Club</h2>
<p>In Yuying Photography Club, our members are nurtured to develop keen observation
skills of their environment and space, using their imagination and creativity
to paint a narrative and using photography as an artistic medium to communicate
their ideas. They are taught basic camera handling techniques and post-production
skills to further enhance their photos. Members get opportunities to go
on learning journeys to different parts of Singapore to hone the photography
skills they have learnt.</p>
