<h2>InnoTech Club</h2>
<p></p>
<p>At InnoTech Club, our members are introduced to the world of robotics
as they learn the basics of building and programming autonomous robots
using sensors. Working together to build an effective robot, they systematically
test and refine programs to develop solutions to complete missions. At
the same time, they also develop teamwork and effective communication skills
which are useful in their future careers.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our members are trained to use a variety of multimedia platforms for broadcast
and production, and they oversee audiovisual support for our schoolâ€™s public
address system during events. The CCA also aims to equip its members with
skills in multimedia presentation, video &amp;amp; graphics editing, movie-making,
coding and Flash animations so as to keep up with ICT trends and industry
shifts.</p>
