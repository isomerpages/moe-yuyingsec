The Sepak Takraw CCA aims to develop our students into athletes who possess a life-long passion for the game by enhancing their game skills. 

  

Each year, we welcome students regardless of their level of experience in the sport. They are given the platform to explore their passion and learn new skills. We encourage our boys to be resilient in facing all challenges, respectful to other players, responsible for their own actions and display integrity especially during competitions.

  

Even after they complete their studies in Yuying Secondary School, our students will continue to develop their skills in the game, both competitively and in recreation. 

  

Especially in the past two years, the boys have demonstrated great resilience. While we took the utmost care to provide a safe, secure and positive learning environment for them, it has been a challenging period of time. Yet, when all physical sessions had to be adapted to online platforms such as Zoom, SLS and Google Forms, our athletes persevered in their learning and self-improvement. They continued to learn, grow and thrive to the best of their abilities, reflecting the core values, resilience, respect and responsibility.
