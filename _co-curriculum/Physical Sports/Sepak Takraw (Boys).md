Sepak Takraw (Boys)
===================

The Sepak Takraw CCA aims to develop our students into athletes who possess a life-long passion for the game by enhancing their game skills.&nbsp;

  

Each year, we welcome students regardless of their level of experience in the sport. They are given the platform to explore their passion and learn new skills. We encourage our boys to be resilient in facing all challenges, respectful to other players, responsible for their own actions and display integrity especially during competitions.

  

Even after they complete their studies in Yuying Secondary School, our students will continue to develop their skills in the game, both competitively and in recreation.
