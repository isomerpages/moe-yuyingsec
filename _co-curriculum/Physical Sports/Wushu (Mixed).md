Wushu is a popular term that is synonymous with Chinese martial arts. Yuying Wushu follows the discipline of ‘taolu’. Similar to gymnastics, there is an emphasis on martial art patterns, maneuvers and aerial techniques such as cartwheels or single and double kicks. Yuying Wushu participates actively in individual and group competitions. Our athletes have performed remarkably well at inter-school competitions and national Wushu and Sanda competitions. Yuying Wushu has also previously sent one of our athletes to represent Singapore in an international competition.

  

Yuying Wushu has proudly and faithfully maintained its 1st to 3rd placing for both individual and group events since 2008. With sheer passion and determination, our athletes have done the school proud not only in national and international competitions, but also at various celebrations and events in our school, such as Speech Day and the Chinese New Year concert. They have also been invited to perform in external events held in other schools, and the Chingay processions in February. 

  

文韬武略 encapsulates the ideals of Yuying Wushu. As a martial arts form, Yuying Wushu inculcates  poise, confidence, resilience and self-control so that our students can excel in various areas. We are committed to building the character of our members who will be responsible and active contributors to the society.
