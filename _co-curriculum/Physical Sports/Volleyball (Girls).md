Yuying Volleyball is an all-girls team. Our volleyball programme in Yuying aims to help our girls develop good balance, flexibility, upper and lower body strength, and speed. In addition to these, our girls are taught sports psychology, trained in team formation, and exposed to various aspects of overall fitness. These have become the trademark strengths of the Yuying Volleyball team when we represent the school in external competitions.

  

Our dedicated coaches help our girls attain their sporting potential by incorporating match simulation drills and developmental techniques in their training sessions. There is great emphasis on improving the girlsâ€™ speed, sense of timing, communication with each other, and ability to work as a team.

  

Our aim is for Yuying Volleyball girls to grow into individuals who possess a strong sense of responsibility, unwavering resilience, and a high level of integrity.
