Rapid movements, jumps, smashes and lifting - Badminton club brings to you the enjoyable indoor sport. Badminton club members are nurtured all-roundedly. Besides building on their physical competencies in the sport, they also develop social emotional competencies such as self-awareness, social-awareness and responsible decision making.  

  

The Badminton club welcomes many members with minimal badminton backgrounds when they first join the CCA in Secondary 1. By the end of their Secondary 4 or 5 year in school, the members will be able to leave the school with relevant skills and experiences both in school and external competitions. In school, students will get a chance to compete in interclass competitions. The school also endeavours to get members to participate in the annual National School Games and other external events. In 2021, ‘B’ division managed to take part in the South zone NSG which was hosted in our school with Good Safe Management Measures (SMM) practices. 

  

The ‘B’ and ‘C’ divisions train together and this fosters team spirit in the CCA. Members forge long-lasting friendships and teamwork through weekly practices. Seniors are given opportunities to lead and mentor junior members, and students take responsibility for the running of the CCA. 

  

We are proud of our members who are passionate and want to develop their skills in the sport and we will continue to work towards helping them grow into better sportsmen, and more importantly - more responsible, disciplined and resilient people.
