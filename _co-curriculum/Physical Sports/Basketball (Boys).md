2022 - National School Games (South Zone) : 2nd Round (B Boys)  

Yuying Basketball Club aims to develop leaders on and off the court. Students are involved in planning and running the basketball programmes so that they get to learn about basketball and its related challenges. The boys are trained physically and mentally to represent our school in the South Zone Basketball National School Games.

The students develop skills required in sports, the ability to work in a team setting, and self-discipline. This is done through a 30-week training programme which aligns with the school’s Vision and Mission.
