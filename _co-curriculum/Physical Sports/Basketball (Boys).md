Yuying Basketball Club aims to develop leaders on and off the court. Students are involved in planning and running the basketball programmes so that they get to learn about basketball and its related challenges. The boys are trained physically and mentally to represent our school in the South Zone Basketball National School Games.

  

The students develop skills required in sports, as well as the ability to work in a team setting and self-discipline. This is done through a 30-week training programme which aligns with the school’s Vision and Mission. As student-players, they are required to focus on both their studies and their on-court competencies. During examination periods, the boys are required to attend a Team Study Programme during which they revise their school work. This takes place prior to their training sessions on Mondays and Wednesdays.
