The Guitar Ensemble is a CCA where students without any prior musical knowledge, but with keenness for hard work and passion for music gather. In this CCA, they learn the basics of guitar playing under the guidance of their instructors and seniors the moment they join the Guitar Ensemble. More importantly, the CCA comes together to make beautiful music, moving together as one.

  

The past two years have proven to be difficult to conduct face-to-face practices. Despite the odds, the Guitar Ensemble adapted well to the circumstances and still carried out online practices (e-CCAs). When the restrictions were eased, we were able to conduct physical training sessions with Safe Management Measures in place. 

  

With their dedication and commitment, the students overcame the odds and emerged triumphant in the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival with a Certificate of Accomplishment. The school is proud of their achievements and dedication to music.
