Yuying’s Malay Dance welcomes both girls and boys, regardless of ethnicity. We thrive with passionate and versatile dancers from different backgrounds, aspiring to tell their stories through  dance skills from different dance genres, beyond the traditional Malay Dance.

  

When the pandemic hit, our dancers were prepared to overcome all odds. The cultivated values of respect and responsibility shone through during Zoom training sessions, as they persevered through the uncertainties as a team. Our achievements include Certificates of Distinction in 2019 and 2021 for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) performances.
