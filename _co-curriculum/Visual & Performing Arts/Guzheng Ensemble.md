Guzheng Ensemble
================
In the Guzheng Ensemble, students learn about the history of the Guzheng instrument, and how to play it with refinement and skill. One does not need any musical knowledge to join the Guzheng Ensemble. By the time they graduate, members of the Ensemble leave the school with relevant skills and performance experiences both in school and in external performances and competitions. The Ensemble grows together and learns together. Members forge close friendships and teamwork through the weekly practices. Seniors are given opportunities to lead and mentor junior members, and students take responsibility for the running of the CCA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are very proud of our consistent growth and we will continue to work towards becoming better musicians, and more importantly, more responsible, disciplined and resilient people.
