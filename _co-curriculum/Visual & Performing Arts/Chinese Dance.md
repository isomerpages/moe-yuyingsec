Chinese Dance
=============
In Yuying Chinese Dance (YYCD), dance members will learn more about the beauty of Chinese dance and movement. Dancers will develop their skills and techniques through basic exercises such as warming up postures, breathing exercises, and learn to better integrate themselves in the dance group and present themselves confidently on stage during performances. This CCA fosters dancersâ€™ passion in Chinese culture, a love of rhythmic and melodic expression, teamwork, and the values of caring and respecting one another.

  

By the end of their secondary school journey, dancers will possess the relevant skills and performance experiences. For instance, they will have opportunities to perform during the Secondary 1 Orientation concert, Lunar New Year celebrations, Speech Day and Open House. Apart from that, dancers will also participate in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival competitions, and other external events and competitions.
