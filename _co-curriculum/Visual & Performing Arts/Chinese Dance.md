Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, online training sessions still continued to ensure that members were actively engaged. The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2021 was the highlight of the year for us. Our dancers received extensive training from their dance instructors to polish up their dance moves. With the Safe Management Measures (SMM) in place, SYF 2021 proved to be more difficult than previous years. The dancers' dedication and passion were evident in their hard work and effort. The dancers brought honour to the school by earning a Certificate of Distinction for SYF 2021.
