24 Seasons Drums
===============
Yuyingâ€™s 24 Seasons Drums was founded in February 2000. Since then, we have had numerous opportunities to perform in public and school events. The CCA emphasises on developing discipline, character and teamwork in its members. A positive attitude on the part of the members is essential for learning and character building.
