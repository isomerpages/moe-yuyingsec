Concert Band
============

<b> “One Band! One Sound!” </b>



This is the energetic cheer you will often hear from Yuying Concert Band, which is made up of over 100 passionate students, five dedicated teachers and two band directors.

Yuying Concert Band believes in working towards musical excellence and providing our members with the opportunities to showcase their musical talents through various performances. To hone their skills, we actively organise and participate in annual music exchanges with local and foreign bands. The concert band has also travelled to Japan and Hong Kong for Immersion Programmes. In our effort to nurture band members into responsible leaders of the future, we conduct leadership camps to instil discipline, teamwork, values, as well as to equip members with the skills and resilience to adapt to changes.

Yuying Concert Band has had a good track record at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging and Arts Presentation. We were invited to participate in several events by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Arts Education Branch (AEB) and other external agencies. We performed for the President at the Istana and was the Band-In-Attendance for the SYF Opening Ceremony held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. Together with five other marching bands, we also performed a marching segment “Youth Celebrate!” at the Singapore Sports Hub as part of the SG50 Celebration. In June 2018, the concert band was invited to collaborate with Yishun Primary Concert Band for a marching segment at the Esplanade Theatre for the MOE SYF Celebration. In 2022, the concert band was invited to perform as one of the virtual bands in National Day Parade 2022 alongside the SAF Band and the SPF Band to kickstart the Parade &amp; Ceremony segment. 2023 was another exciting and rewarding year for the band as we were awarded the Certificate of Distinction at SYF. The journey was tough, but the members persevered and displayed resilience to overcome the challenges they faced.
