<b> “One Band! One Sound!” </b>

This is the energetic cheer you will often hear from Yuying Concert Band (YYCB) which is made up of about 100 passionate students, 5 dedicated teachers and 2 band directors.

  

In Yuying Concert Band, our members are provided with the opportunity to showcase their musical talents through public performances. Programmes such as combined schools year-end concerts, mentorship and music exchanges will be specially organised together with our sister school bands (Yishun Primary Concert Band, Pasir Ris Secondary Concert Band and Bukit Panjang Government High School Concert Band) for our band members. Our members also get the opportunity to hone their musical skills by attending music workshops conducted by professional Band Conductors which will be organised annually. 

  

In our effort to nurture the members as responsible future leaders, we conduct Leadership Camp to instill discipline, teamwork and values in them, as well as to empower the members with the skills and resilience to adapt to challenges.
YYCB has a good track record over the years in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation and was invited to participate in several events by the Ministry of Education (MOE) Arts Education Branch (AEB) and other external agencies.
