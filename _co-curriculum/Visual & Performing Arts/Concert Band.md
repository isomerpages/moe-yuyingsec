Despite having our planned CCA activities disrupted due to the ongoing pandemic, Yuying Concert Band (YYCB) has emerged stronger than ever by overcoming all the challenges that came our way as one united band. Our members continued to engage in the learning of music through the various online platforms where they displayed extraordinary levels of commitment and resilience as they quickly adapted to the new challenging way of learning music and playing their instrument online. We also once again conducted an e-investiture via ZOOM with live streaming for invited family members and friends. We made it a point to acknowledge the efforts put in by our members as we promoted them to their next rank in the CCA and share the joy with their families.   

  

In 2021, we managed to obtain Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation for both our Flexi Band, as well as, Percussion Ensemble. In addition, we were also invited to perform the 2021 NDP Song (The Road Ahead) in a virtual collaboration with SAF band. Although we only had a short runway and very limited time to prepare for the above, our band members displayed tremendous resilience and perseverance during all our training sessions. We are really proud of them!
