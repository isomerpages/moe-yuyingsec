Yuying’s 24 Seasons Drums was founded in February 2000. Since then, we have had numerous opportunities to perform in public and school events. The CCA emphasises on developing discipline, character and teamwork in its members. A positive attitude on the part of the members is essential for learning and character building.

  

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic for the past two years, our spirits have not been dampened. In line with Safe Management measures, we continued to engage our members through e-CCA, focusing on strengthening their knowledge in reading and composing scores.

  

With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, our CCA is glad to be able to resume face-to-face trainings and also participate in public performances. We are honored to be invited to perform in the Paya Lebar Kovan Community Club’s 2022 Mid-Autumn Festival celebration and Hainan Business Chamber 12th Anniversary Dinner.
