As part of an international uniformed youth group which is the oldest in continuous existence in the world, the Boys’ Brigade (BB) offers a well-balanced programme which aims to engage, excite, challenge and reward our Boys through interesting and meaningful life-enriching activities. The Company places emphasis on learning and character-building through adventure, via a range of activities including kayaking, archery, abseiling, rock-climbing, cycling, team-building activities and other ad-hoc sports-related activities. This consistent focus has produced Boys who are driven, confident, disciplined and excellent team players.
