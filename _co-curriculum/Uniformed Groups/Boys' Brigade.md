As part of an international uniformed youth group which is the oldest in continuous existence in the world, the Boysâ€™ Brigade (BB) offers a well-balanced programme which aims to engage, excite, challenge and reward our Boys through interesting and meaningful life enriching activities. The Company places emphasis on learning and character building through adventure, via a range of activities including kayaking, archery, abseiling, rock climbing, cycling, team building activities and other ad-hoc sports related activities. This consistent focus has produced Boys who are driven, confident, disciplined and excellent team players.
