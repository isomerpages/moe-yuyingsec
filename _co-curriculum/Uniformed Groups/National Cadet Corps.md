National Cadet Corps
====================

In the NCC, our cadets learn to become inspiring leaders and committed citizens through fun, adventurous and military related activities. The NCC aims to complement the academic education of our boys by providing them with the relevant practical training to enhance their mental and physical capabilities. As they move through their secondary school life, cadets learn to take on challenges which will help them in their personal growth as student leaders.

They will be exposed to the discipline and rigour of a soldier such as learning how to put on their No. 4 pixelated uniform, performing basic drills and learning the proper procedures of handling and firing the SAR 21 rifle. They will also have the opportunity to compete against other NCC units in competitions such as the Fitness Challenge, District Sports Championship and the Precision Drill Squad Competition.&nbsp;

Many of the Cadets have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills through their time in secondary school, rising up the ranks and graduating as Staff Sergeants, with many moving on to become Cadet Officers at their respective tertiary institutions.
