In the NCC, our cadets learn to become inspiring leaders and committed citizens through fun, adventurous and military related activities. The NCC aims to complement the academic education of our boys by providing them with the relevant practical training to enhance their mental and physical capabilities. As they move through their secondary school life, cadets learn to take on challenges which will help them in their personal growth as student leaders.

They will be exposed to the discipline and rigour of a soldier such as learning how to put on their No. 4 pixelated uniform, performing basic drills and learning the proper procedures of handling and firing the SAR 21 rifle. They will also have the opportunity to compete against other NCC units in competitions such as the Fitness Challenge, District Sports Championship and the Precision Drill Squad Competition. 

Many of the Cadets have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills through their time in secondary school, rising up the ranks and graduating as Staff Sergeants, with many moving on to become Cadet Officers at their respective tertiary institutions. 

  

COVID-19 has forced the NCC to cancel or suspend many of the core training and competitions over the last two years. The whole NCC fraternity has worked hard to keep the cadets engaged. We are very lucky to have the full support of NCC HQ which helped to reformat many of the face-to-face activities into online training packages for the safety of our cadets and Teacher Officers. 

  

2021 has been a challenging year but the NCC spirit remains strong and alive. We are very  hopeful that our cadets will continue to receive a fulfilling experience in 2022.
