St. John Brigade Singapore exists because of its Vision and Motto “For the Faith” and “For the Service of Mankind”. Members are trained in Basic First Aid (BFA) and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Equipped with professional knowledge and life-saving skills, cadets will practice and gain first-hand experiences when they carry out public duties. Cadets will also receive holistic training in the area of event planning, leadership, responsibility and teamwork. Cadets can gain experiences and badges in four main areas: welfare and services, outdoor activities, and craft and hobbies.

  

**Training Sessions** 

Our weekly training sessions are held on Friday afternoons from 2.30PM to 5.30PM. On many occasions, our cadets are also sent out for educational and enrichment activities planned by St. John Singapore HQ.
