The Girls’ Brigade's mission is to develop each girl and officer to her fullest potential by equipping, empowering and enabling every girl to be a leader, and every officer to be a servant leader. The CCA serves as a platform for our girls to develop in character and hone their leadership skills through our purposeful GB sessions, and the annual camps and events organised for the girls. Our activities aim to nurture our girls to be adept educationally, spiritually, socially, as well as physically, preparing them to make a difference in society. 

  

The Girls' Brigade 70th Company has provided our girls with valuable experiences and meaningful interactions. This has developed a sense of pride and belonging in our girls towards the CCA, and has led to graduated seniors coming back to help out with activities planned by the company. Through passion and hard work, the 70th Company has achieved good results thus far, achieving the Company Gold Award consecutively for the past 13 years since 2009.
