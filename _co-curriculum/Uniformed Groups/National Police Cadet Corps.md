The Mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe. The Vision of the National Police Cadet Corps is to become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world.

Yuying NPCC Unit strives to realise the Corps' Mission and Vision by providing all our cadets with interesting and exciting activities throughout their lives in secondary school. We believe that training and learning go hand in hand. To this end, we tailor our training sessions with the improvement of each cadet's mental and physical abilities in mind. We believe this will equip our cadets with the skills and mindset necessary to be productive and good citizens of Singapore.
