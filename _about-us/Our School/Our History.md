Our History
===========

![](/images/History.png)

Yuying Secondary School was founded by the Hainanese Community in 1910 as a Chinese-medium high school. At that time, it was located at Prinsep Street and named Yock Eng High School. The school began with an enrolment of only 15 students. However, it soon outgrew its premises as the enrolment continued to climb. In 1939, the School Management Board initiated a campaign to raise funds for new premises.

  

In 1941, the school moved to a new campus at 65 Tanjong Katong Road. The school programme was disrupted by the outbreak of World War II. During the War, the school premises were occupied by the Japanese armed forces. The school reopened its doors to pupils in July 1946 with an enrolment of 600. The post-war years were a period of rapid growth for the school, in terms of enrolment and recognition. In 1958, enrolment stood at a peak of 2400 pupils. During the 1960s and 70s, there was a shift towards English-medium education vis a vis Chinese-medium education. Thus, the school admitted its first batch of English-stream students in 1981. In 1988, the last batch of Chinese stream students graduated.

  

On 9 Dec 1985, the school relocated to its present premises at 47 Hougang Ave 1. The school was renamed Yuying Secondary School and was officially opened on 13 Aug 1987.

  

In 2015, an agreement which would last for the next 30 years was signed between the School Management Committee and the Ministry of Education. Yuying would continue as a Government-Aided secondary school, with the School Management Committee and School Alumni Association (founded in 1994) continuing to actively support the school programmes.  While Yuying has journeyed through more than a century, its educational beliefs remain the same - to nurture each generation of individuals and equip them with the skills to achieve personal excellence.
