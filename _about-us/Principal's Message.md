****Radiating Gratitude in the Yuying Community****

<p align="center">
	​​“Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.”
</p><p align="center">
―&nbsp;Mark Twain
</p>	

<p>Yuying Secondary School had an exhilarating 2025. As we look back with great fondness on our school’s 115th anniversary celebration, our hearts are filled with gratitude for the wonderful support from friends, partners and our school management. It was a heartwarming sight with many cohorts of alumni returning to share the joy at the gala dinner and homecoming event. </p>	
<p>The immense sense of collective pride for Yuying was clearly evident in the Yuying community. Long may the spirit of gratitude live on in our hearts like what Priya (3 Gratitude, 2025) reflected:</p>	

<p align="center">“I’m especially grateful to Yuying for shaping my resilience, teaching me to stay strong while juggling studies, giving me the chance to plan CCA sessions and help organise prefect activities. These have made me tougher and more adaptable to challenges. Yuying gave me a community – teachers, peers, juniors, and seniors – who always cheered me on.”  </p>	

<p>Looking back, we can be proud to say that we have lived out our school motto – Together, Achieve Personal Excellence.  </p>	
<p>Together, the staff and students navigated through different challenges to ensure that teaching and learning went on as effectively and in as holistic a manner as possible. Together, the teachers learnt and collaborated to find ways to make lessons more engaging and deepen students’ learning by leveraging the affordance of generative AI. Together, the teachers made our school’s Enterprise Week, Applied Learning for Life Programme and Student Leadership Development Programme more engaging and applicable to students’ daily lives. Together, the teachers nurtured Yuying students in the right values to contribute towards the betterment of others in the community. </p>	

<p>Staff and students – Thank you for doing your best!</p>	
<p>2026 promises to be another exciting year for all of us at Yuying. As we embark on Yuying’s next lap of development, we want to let graciousness and kindness permeate throughout the school. We want to make gratitude our way of life and let appreciation of others emanate from us to encourage those around us.  </p>	

<p>	Guided by our school motto, ‘Together, Achieve Personal Excellence’, we will continue to stay true to our mission of ‘nurturing a curiosity to learn and a heart to serve’ in every Yuying student. We will continue to strengthen student well-being and resilience for every Yuying Eagle to flourish and continue to pursue a better version of themselves. We will promote deep and engaged learning among Yuying Eagles to bring about a sense of success and a zest for life. In so doing, we aspire for <b>every Yuying <u>EAGLE</u> to be an <u>E</u>nterprising, <u>A</u>daptable, <u>G</u>racious, <u>L</u>eader of the Future</b>.</p>	
<p>	Our school’s emblem of the soaring eagle reminds us of the many profound lessons we can learn from the eagle. One of the eagle’s characteristics is its adaptability. Adult eagles make their nests increasingly uncomfortable for their young to force them to leave the comfort of the nest and learn to fly. We, too, should take a step out of our comfort zone to experience growth. It is in the struggle with the unfamiliar and the unknown that our resilient muscles develop to help us grow stronger.</p>	
<p>	In this new year, let us continue to draw inspiration from our school’s heritage and our school’s identity. Let us invoke the pioneering spirit – the ‘can do’ spirit to enable every Yuying Eagle to become a <b>Lifelong Learner, Compassionate Leader, Enterprising Changemaker and Responsible Citizen</b>, anchored on the school values of <b>Integrity, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility</b>. </p>	
<p>	We are keenly aware that we cannot walk this journey alone. I humbly invite all our parents and valued stakeholders to support and partner us as we continue ‘Soaring Higher Together’.</p>	

<p>	With gratitude,</p>
