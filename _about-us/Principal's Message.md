**Yuying@113: Soaring Higher Together**


This year, we celebrate Yuying Secondary School’s 113th anniversary. Over the past decades, Yuying Secondary School has stayed true to the core of its mission. Students who have walked through the gates of the school would attest to having been positively impacted, and having their lives transformed and potential unleashed. Under the leadership of Mr Lo Chee Lin from 2016 to 2022, the school had continued to provide quality school experiences to meet the learning needs of every Yuying student. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to Mr Lo and we wish him all the very best in his retirement. 


I am deeply honoured to be entrusted with the stewardship of Yuying Secondary School. As the 18th Principal (since records started in 1946), I stand on the shoulders of giants – the many Principals who have laboured with love and taken the school to where it is today. I endeavour to build on their good work, further strengthen the Yuying spirit and let the love of Yuying spread throughout the Yuying community. 

  

Our school motto, ‘**Together, Achieve Personal Excellence**’, will continue to be the key tenet of education in Yuying Secondary School. We will continue to embrace every child and strive to nurture every Yuying student to be ‘**Wholesome Individuals with a Global Mindset, Passion to Learn and Spirit to Serve**’ – a leader with a strong sense of purpose and motivation to better the lives of others. 

  

Yuying students will continue to enjoy an innovative and engaging curriculum anchored on our school values of **Integrity, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility**. Our school’s signature Applied Learning Programme (Fostering Innovation through Design Thinking) and Learning for Life Programme (Yuying C.A.R.E.S), coupled with the exciting line up of CCA and student development experiences, aim to equip every child with 21st century competencies and instil the love for learning in them. Through a caring and supportive school environment, Yuying students will also learn social-emotional skills and the right citizenship dispositions to navigate life’s challenges. 


As Team Yuying embarks on reimagining education and furthering efforts on leveraging affordances of digital technology to enhance teaching and learning, we are keenly aware that we cannot walk this journey alone. We need strong support to **uplift every Yuying student to enable every child to be a Lifelong Learner, Compassionate Leader, Enterprising Changemaker and Responsible Citizen**. I humbly invite all our valued parents and stakeholders to partner us as we write the next chapter of Yuying Secondary School.
