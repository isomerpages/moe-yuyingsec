Principal's Message
===================
“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a
habit.” – Will Durant

The past year had been an invigorating journey for all the students and
staff here at Yuying Secondary School. The return of many of the student development experiences enabled students and staff to come together and share beautiful collective memories while strengthening their bonds.

Together, the staff and students navigated through different challenges to ensure that teaching and learning went on as effectively and in as holistic a manner as possible. Together, the staff and students from our six Visual and Performing Arts CCA rose above themselves to achieve admirable outcomes at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2023. Together, the staff and students from our five Sports CCA competed with determination and did the school proud at the National School Games 2023.

Together, the teachers learnt and collaborated to find ways to make lessons in our Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life Programme more engaging, leveraging the affordance of the Personal
Learning Device. Together, the teachers designed packages for self-paced learning on regular Home-Based Learning days. Together, the teachers nurtured Yuying students in the right values, to the best of
their abilities.

Staff, Teachers, and Students – Yuying Secondary School salutes you.

2024 promises to be another exciting year for the Yuying Secondary School community.

Guided by our school motto, ‘**Together, Achieve Personal Excellence’,** we will continue to stay true to our mission of **nurturing a curiosity to learn and a heart to serve** in every Yuying Eagle. We will continue to strengthen student well-being and resilience for every Yuying Eagle to flourish. We will promote deep and engaged learning among Yuying Eagles to bring about greater motivation and zest for life. In so doing, we aspire for **every Yuying EAGLE to be Enterprising, Adaptable, Gracious, Leaders of the Future.**

Our school’s emblem of the soaring eagle reminds us of the many profound lessons we can learn from the eagle. One of the eagle’s characteristics is its remarkable vision: a piercing sharp focus which enables it to home in on its target with pinpoint accuracy from a distance. We, too, can develop this discipline of determined focus through repeated practice until it becomes a habit of mind and an instinct in our pursuit of excellence.

As we celebrate our school’s 114 th anniversary this year, we endeavour to draw inspiration from our school’s history and our school’s identity. We will relive the pioneering spirit – the can-do spirit to innovate and be inventive while leveraging affordances of digital technology to enhance teaching and learning. We are keenly aware that we cannot walk this journey alone. We need strong support to uplift every Yuying Eagle to enable every child to be a **Lifelong Learner, Compassionate Leader, Enterprising Changemaker and Responsible Citizen**, anchored on the school values of **Integrity, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility**. I humbly invite all our valued parents and stakeholders to support and partner us on the road ahead. We did it before and we will do it again in 2024.

***Soaring Higher Together***
