### Yuying Parent Support Group

Yuying PSG was formed in July 2003 to engage parents in the process of educating our students.

育英中学家长会成立于2003年7月, 目的让家张们共同参与教育学生的过程。

  

The PSG is a partnership between parent volunteers and the school for the people who matter the most to us – Our Children.

因为关心青少年学生的成长以及重视学术上的成绩，家长会是一个让家长与学校立合作伙伴的自愿性组织。

  

The vision of the PSG is for parents to put their love and concern for their child into action by working with the school to achieve Yuying’s mission and vision for the students.

通过家长对孩子的关爱, 携手与校方共同栽培孩子的未来, 完成教育的使命和愿景。

  

PSG aims to create opportunities for closer interaction between parents, principals and teachers and develop a greater understanding and commitment to the mission, vision and direction of the school.

加强家长，校长以及教师之间有效的沟通桥梁。让家长进一步了解校方在教育方面的政策，使命与愿景。
