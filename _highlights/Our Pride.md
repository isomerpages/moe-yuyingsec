### Realising my Dream One Step at a Time

_Defying the odds to succeed and fulfil my passion to serve others_

Receiving the President’s Award 2019 affirmed my passion to serve others and made every part of my life’s journey worthwhile. Being the first Yuying Secondary School alumnus to receive this award, I hope to inspire my juniors to reach for their dreams with my journey.  I struggled academically when I first entered secondary school. Feeling demoralised, I became disengaged and began to focus less on my studies. Fortunately, the phase did not last long for I found my way upon joining Boys’ Brigade (BB). I was blessed with nurturing officers and seniors who motivated me and supported my emotionally and academically. Inspired by them, I began to see improvements in my studies. With buoyed confidence and enhanced leadership skills, I soon found myself actively serving in both BB and the Prefectorial Board Executive Committee.

Having experienced the BB program first-hand, I can vouch that the CCA provides an excellent platform to mentor youths.  Currently as the Head Primer in Yuying BB, I took every opportunity to journey with my juniors through regular Company parades and trainings to prepare them for competitions such as the BB Blaze. I see this as an opportunity for me to give back to the Brigade and my Company for providing me with valuable guidance during my secondary school days. 

  

Upon graduation, I have expanded my service to Brigade-level activities and is part of the organising committee for the Primers’ Orientation, taking on the role as the chairman. My role entails working with Primers from the different Polytechnic Companies and working with them to come up with activities for the participating Primers, with the aim of increasing networking and sharing of best practices among them. On top of that, I was part of the drama production committee for Life Community Services Society where I put up a performance for children during Christmas while mentoring other actors in the performance.
