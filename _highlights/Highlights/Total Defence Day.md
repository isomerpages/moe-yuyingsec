On 16 February 2022, staff and students from Uniformed Groups donned their uniforms to show solidarity and commitment to Total Defence in Singapore. Students watched 2 e-skits to learn more about the 6 pillars of Total Defence. The first skit was on “Chingay50”, where students learnt about the history and purpose of the Chingay parade as a showcase of the vibrancy of Singaporeans’ ethnicity and culture. The second skit is on HDB housing in Singapore, which has served as a foundation of nation building by providing equal opportunities to housing, and therefore psychological security for our people.
