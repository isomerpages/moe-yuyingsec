All Singapore Mathematics Competition 2022
==========================================

A group of our students represented Yuying Secondary in an annual competition for the Normal Course students in Singapore, where they competed with over 800 students from 82 schools. The students were tested on algebra, problem solving, geometry and statistics, amongst other topics.

  

Our students demonstrated resilience as they persevered through hours of training and demonstrated what it meant to be a lifelong learner. We are very proud to announce that the students overcame all odds and clinched the 1 st position in the Upper Sec NA Team Category as well as the 1st , 2nd and 17 th positions in the Upper Sec NA Individual Category!

  

Well done to Josh, Krish and Nigel from 4N1!
