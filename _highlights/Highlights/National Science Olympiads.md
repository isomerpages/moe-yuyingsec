National Science Olympiads
==========================

All 3 disciplines of the Science Department -  Biology, Chemistry and Physics, had sent in students to participate in their respective Junior Olympiads this year. The Olympiad is an annual competition that provides a platform for Upper Secondary students to stretch their capabilities in the scientific disciplines they love. Through unique and demanding scenarios, our students were challenged to think deeply and critically while developing excitement for knowledge beyond their textbooks. They were enthusiastic throughout the competition and gave their all, competing at the National level against students from many other schools in Singapore.  

  

We are delighted that the students have learnt a lot through this wonderful opportunity, and their joy of learning was evident in their participation. Furthermore, we are happy to announce that the following students have done our school proud by achieving some notable awards!
