Student Initiated Learning (SIL)
================================

The Student Initiated Learning (SIL) programme helps students to grow to be independent lifelong learners. Home-Based Learning (HBL) days provide the dedicated time and space for students to explore their interests within and beyond the curriculum.

  

At YYSS, students who share similar interests pursue their interests together. Form teachers role-model self-directed learning through their hobbies, and facilitate conversations to support the students’ growth in their SIL journey.

  

From coding, crocheting, cooking, playing a music instrument or learning a new language, you name it, we have it!
