CCA Achievements 2022
=====================

**Girlâ€™s Brigade**

  

_YYSS Girls' Brigade's 12th Company Gold Award for 13 Consecutive Years_

  

Yuying Secondary School's Girls' Brigade, 70th Company, has received yet another Company Gold Award for 2021. The Girls' Brigade has received a total of 12 Gold Awards for 13 consecutive years (2009-2021). Even though 2021 had been a challenging year as the Covid-19 safe management measures made it difficult for the Company to fulfil some of the more stringent criteria for the Company Award, the tenacity and team work of the girls, along with guidance from teachers and Volunteer Adult Leaders has made it possible for the Company to achieve success. YYSS believes that the 70th Company Girls' Brigade will continue to achieve success in the future.
