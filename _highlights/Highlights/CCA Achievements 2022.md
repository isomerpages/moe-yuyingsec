CCA Achievements 2022
=====================

**Girlâ€™s Brigade**

  

_YYSS Girls' Brigade's 12th Company Gold Award for 13 Consecutive Years_

  

Yuying Secondary School's Girls' Brigade, 70th Company, has received yet another Company Gold Award for 2021. The Girls' Brigade has received a total of 12 Gold Awards for 13 consecutive years (2009-2021). Even though 2021 had been a challenging year as the Covid-19 safe management measures made it difficult for the Company to fulfil some of the more stringent criteria for the Company Award, the tenacity and team work of the girls, along with guidance from teachers and Volunteer Adult Leaders has made it possible for the Company to achieve success. YYSS believes that the 70th Company Girls' Brigade will continue to achieve success in the future.

**NCC**

  

The past two years have been a difficult one for the CCA with incoming students not being able to experience the true essence of being a NCC cadet. Training was carried out online and many of the activities which were meant to be done at NCC HQ had to be converted into online training packages. Nevertheless there was a concerted effort by all to ensure that training remained engaging and that the cadets were adequately trained in order to be promoted. The Unit Recognition was suspended in 2020 due to Covid-19 but was revived again in 2021. Our unit achieved Distinction yet again for the 3rd time in a row. As a unit, we are extremely proud to have kept the fire burning as we forge on back to full normalcy.

  

To Serve with Pride and Dedication!

**NPCC**

  

It is with great pleasure to announce that Yuying NPCC has achieved Gold in the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) for the year 2021. The UOPA is an annual assessment which can only be achieved due to the active participation of the cadets, achievement in various competitions, cadets' promotion and awards, as well as the guidance and effort of our teachers and alumni.
