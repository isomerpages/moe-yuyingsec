Guitar Ensemble VIA Project
===========================

### VIA Project
-----------

On April 11 2022, the Guitar Ensemble carried out our CCA VIA project where we put in time and effort into creating a goodie bag and recorded some performances for students at the Sheng Hong Student Care Center, just opposite our school. For weeks before that, we were planning with our sections on what items we should get for the children that will be beneficial and useful for them. We made sure to set a budget and got everyoneâ€™s help to contribute.

  

On the day of the packing, each section bought different items to be packed into the goodie bags. We had stationery items like pencils and highlighters for the students to use while studying for their upcoming exams. We also had our Sec 1s, 2s and 3s to help make handwritten cards of encouragement and care while our Sec 4s helped with the packing of items. We made sure to pack every bag with care and love.

  

After packing everything, our teachers-in-charge and some of our Guitar Ensemble members took the time to send the goodie bags to the center where they were distributed to the students. We also learnt new pieces of music and recorded videos of us performing for the children. We played three pieces of music -- Yakimochi, Beauty and the Beast and Grandfather's Clock. It was a challenge for us to master these pieces in a short span of time, but we managed to do it. In the process, we learnt to manage our time more efficiently and we hope that the children love our recordings because we really put our best effort into recording the performance.

  

We all had fun being a part of this VIA activity. We see VIA programmes as a way to bring people together. After this experience, we realised that everyone had a role to play in our CCA. We bonded, became closer and communicated with each other more than usual, especially with peers across levels. We got to work with each other and learn more about the values like teamwork and perseverance. It is such a great feeling that we are also able to contribute to our community in our own way.

  

What a memorable and fun experience it was!
