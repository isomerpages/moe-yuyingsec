PW-VIA 2022
===========

### Final Presentation


The PW-VIA (Project Work - Values-in-Action) final presentation was concluded on 25th May 2022. It was a culmination of the hard work and effort of our Sec 2 students for the past 5 months. Representatives from each Sec 2 class shared their classesâ€™ journey in engaging the elderly, and reflected on the process of working together.

  

The PW-VIA is a platform where students come together, learning and working in teams. They apply Design Thinking skills through empathizing and understanding the needs of the elderly. After which, they propose and enact suitable activities to meet the needs of the target group.
