<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Fostering Innovation through Design Thinking</strong>
</p>
<p>Our <strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong> empowers students
to tackle real-world challenges through creativity and problem-solving.
Through collaborations with partners like the <strong>Singapore Institute of Technology</strong> and <strong>Super Bean International (more commonly known as Mr Bean)</strong>,
students explore practical solutions for sustainability, such as reducing
food waste in the canteen and repurposing soya bean pulp into innovative
food products. These hands-on experiences nurture critical thinking, innovation,
and resilience, equipping students to confidently face future challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Yuying CARES</strong>
</p>
<p>Through our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong>, <em>Yuying CARES</em> (<em>Collaborate, Act, Reflect, Empathise, and Serve</em>),
students develop strong character and learn to make a meaningful impact
in the world. Using the design thinking framework, students research and
understand challenges faced by various communities, creating thoughtful
solutions to address their needs. From promoting sustainability and supporting
the elderly to advocating for mental health awareness, students take purposeful
action with empathy and care.</p>

<p><strong>STEM Programme: Igniting Curiosity and Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>Our <strong>STEM programme</strong> – focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics – encourages curiosity, critical thinking, and innovation
through hands-on learning and the scientific inquiry model. Students tackle
exciting challenges such as experimenting with chemical-powered cars, exploring
virtual reality for complex mathematical concepts, coding and programming
drones using Python, and delving into the potential of hydrogen fuel cells
as a renewable energy source. These engaging experiences nurture creativity,
problem-solving skills, and a future-ready mindset, preparing students
to become leaders and innovators in a rapidly evolving world.</p>

<p><strong>Student Leadership: Every Student a Leader</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe every student has the potential to lead. Through a wide range
of leadership opportunities, including Prefects, CCA Leaders, and Class
Executive Committee roles, students develop confidence and take ownership
of planning and organising exciting school events. These experiences nurture
compassionate leaders who serve their communities with pride and purpose,
equipping them with the skills to lead with confidence and empathy.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability Education: Nurturing Environmental Stewards</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability Education</strong> is a whole-school effort to inspire
students to become environmentally conscious leaders. Through our campus,
curriculum, culture, and community, students learn to embrace sustainability
in meaningful ways. From growing rice and understanding the importance
of reducing food waste to fostering a school-wide culture of recycling
and mindful living, students gain hands-on experience in sustainability.
Additionally, selected students collaborate with Dyson-NTU, applying design
thinking to address environmental challenges with a focus on energy sustainability.</p>
